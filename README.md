This website is built using several compilable languages:

- The HTML pages are built from **pug** template files.
- The CSS stylesheet is pre-compiled from **sass** files.
- The JS scripts are trans-compiled from **es6** (ES2015) files.

To make any modifications re-compilation is necessary. You should install:

- **node** and **npm**
- **yarn**

    gulp scripts
    ```
