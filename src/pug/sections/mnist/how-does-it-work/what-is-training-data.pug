h3 What is training data?

p Training data is the basis to make a neural network do what you desire. It is usually a large set of sample <b>inputs combined with the desired outputs</b>. Often a big part of the training data (for example 80%) is used to <b>train the network</b>, while the remaining part (for example 20%) is used to <b>test the network</b> and see its performance / accuracy. Training data is very valuable, and fortunately there are open databases like the <b>MNIST database</b> we used for this exhibit.

p In the case of this exhibit (Neural Numbers), we have 70 000 images of handwritten numbers (input) and the number it depicts:

p TODO Insert a random selection of the images (maybe it can change).

p The training data is “unified or cleaned”, all pictures are 28 x 28 pixels and the image drawn is centered. Whenever you draw a number, your drawing will be transformed to such a sample image.

p TODO Insert the transform sample from handwritten to to 28 x 28 pixels interactive element.
